# Defarm-OI
### Orgonic Intelligence Defarm Exo-cortex, a collaborative resource log

**This markdown document is for the concentration of helpful videos, articles and formulas that serve to educate defarm participants on how to effectively establish their operation and enliven their crops.**

At the moment this document is public but only known to the plantsinside defarm groupchat.

There are also topics which are of great interest to our group that have not been covered in depth. I will include a rough sketch of the unexplored topics.

As a defarmer, feel free to add a resource that has helped you understand something in the past in the general section. You can also tackle the unexplored topics below that. Please insert your submissions in such a way that they are pleasant to look at and informative.

# Quick Tutorial

This tutorial is a loose description of what it takes to create your own grow situation. There are a lot of options and choices to make and this tutorial is meant to highlight those choices.

### Easy:

The easiest way to get a grow going is to go to a garden store and purchase a plant. Some farmers markets even have plant sections. They come with dirt and are usually pretty happy and taken care of. You will likely have to repot the purchased plant from the plastic container into a more perminant vessel. A lot of the time, you'll want to avoid plastic pots or ceramic glaze pots because they don't let moisture escape. Terra cotta pots are cheap and plant root systems like them.

When getting plants for your home, make sure you have a good idea of how much light you get through your windows. If your house has large south facing windows and no trees blocking the sun, you are able to keep plants that are light hungry. Most house plants are popular for their inclination for shade so you can manage pretty well if you set the right expectations. 

The size of the pot for the plant should closely resemble the action happening above ground. You should also be sure that the soil you get has some form of fertilizer. Potting soil from the store should do the trick. Check your plant species for more specifications about what their needs are for moisture. Try to keep heir soil how they like it and think happy thoughts. You'll do great!

### Hard:

The hard way to grow plants is to use technology. This is harder because technology is clumsy and stupid. It takes a lot of preparation for technology to meet the needs of plant life, and it still isn't fully automatic. Besides, computers can't think the happy thoughts that really make plants grow faster. Regardless, it is a great way to grow plants that wouldn't otherwise thrive in your home.

Once you step out into automation, you are standing in for Mother Nature. It's a big responsibility. Make sure you have a plan for the following crucial things:

Water, Light, Air, Nutrients

If you are still using potted soil, you just need to automate lights, fans and peristaltic pumps for water. Usually people who take this approach use a soil moisture sensor to help with the water automation. The light and air automation can be as simple as a timer plug set to however may hours the plant needs. It's good to enclose the grow to contain the heat of the lamp as well as protect the grow from pests. Grow tents are plentiful online. If the aesthetic of a grow tent is beneath you, I would recommend building something that encompasses the tent to suit your fancy.

To step out into the soilless, you will need to plumb a hydroponic system and be responsible for the nutrient levels. This is a very delicate process, but it can bring greater yields if you can get the hang of it. Different plants require a different method of water delivery. Lettuces and simple low plants can be grown on a float tray, where tomatoes appreciate an ebb and flow system. Most setups feature a Nutrient Film Technique and there are 3 others.

# WANTED WANTED BOUNTY INFO WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE

The mission of defarm is to consolidate all independent gardeners and growers into a network of experimental feedback iteration that will drive vertical farm efficiency to the optimized limit.

#Data market
In order to encourage adoption, there must be a gain for the defarmer to participate. I believe we can create a grow data market that compensates defarmers for their contribution. The infrastructure that makes this possible today is ocean protocol.

The task at hand is to march toward the critical mass moment when our defarmer nodes become a data harvesting operation that rivals the research and development branches of vertical farming corporations. In order to get there, we need to make our data as tantalizing as possible to them. So the question is:

1. How does a defarm user organize their plant growth data in a standardized format that vertical farms already use or could feasibly accomodate?

Assuming the most basic grow sense apparatus contains: Light lux, Air temp/humidity, Water temp/pH/EC and a webcam, what are the sensing intervals that create a complete picture of what's happening in the grow without being too bloated? (i.e. all measurements every second)

I like 200s intervals since there are 432 of these in a day.

# AI
The point of the datamarket is to feed machine learning algorithms that are training to understand plant growth. Before the defarm reaches the critical mass of grow data and user activity, I propose that grant money be used to train an in-house algorithm with the intention of developing a general agricultural AI.

2. How do you train a general agriculture AI?
Reinforcement Learning trained on controlled environment agriculture systems
Computer Vision trained on plant livestream

# Hackathon
Not everyone can afford a fully equipped, standard issue experimental defarm node device. But there are other simpler grow apparatuses that can integrate into the defarm through data collection. We need a MVP defarm node that consists of a water proof raspberry pi, webcam, light sensor and humidity sensor.
